            <p>
              Gatherly was born from the simple observation that finding and attending 
              great events shouldn't be complicated. Our founders, passionate event-goers 
              themselves, noticed the gap between amazing events happening everywhere and 
              people's ability to discover them.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a weekend project quickly grew into a mission to democratize 
              event discovery. Today, we're proud to serve thousands of event organizers 
              and hundreds of thousands of attendees across the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking forward, we're committed to continuously innovating and improving 
              our platform to make event discovery even more personalized, accessible, 
              and enjoyable for everyone.
